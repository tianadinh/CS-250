# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The most effective method for incorporating user needs into a program is to deconstruct those needs Personally, I would consider what the overall functionality is as well
  as what features they would like to see included. Since we are primarily concerned with completing the functionality of a project and will worry about the appearance later,
  my initial iterations would involve a basic setup with little to no formatting and no elements to make the program "pop." By providing a goal of what the user wants the
  program to accomplish, user stories aid in implementation by helping to deconstruct the user's need with a little more specific information. 


# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  As previously mentioned, in order to prevent work overload, I approach program development by segmenting the program into distinct parts. You can basically think of these
  little goals to reach. One of the agile processes I want to use in my future work is to improve my ability to quickly plan my development using the knowledge of what needs
  to be done. The necessity of concentrating development efforts on items that add value to the program rather than those that are purely aesthetic is another aspect of agile 
  that I would like to include.


# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I think that having excellent team communication is a prerequisite for being a good team player. You can communicate, which is why it's so crucial, but effective communication 
  entails being able to explain concepts and plans in a way that everyone can understand. It would take some time for the team to figure out what information is most effective
  for team development, but once it is, it can be very beneficial to the business.
